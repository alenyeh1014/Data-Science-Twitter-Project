# NBA Predictions with Twitter
Hi all, this is a Data Science Project ! - Twitter Analytics with Machine Learning and Deep Learning Methodologies.


### Project Objective

* The purpose of this project is to apply Machine Learning and Deep Learning Methodologies in Social Media Analytics such as 
Twitter in order to forecast NBA result predictions in this project.

* Matplotlib, Scipy, Seaborn, Keras


### Project Description

* Motivation:

  - It is simple and straightforward since we are all sport fans and twitter lovers making a related project seems persuasive and reasonable for us ! 
  - Thus, we would like to apply ML and DL methodologies to predict the NBA game results from Twitter. 
  - Furthermore, the accuracy of each methodology is also crucial and practical for users friendly.  
  
* Details:

  - There are total 30 teams in the NBA league and can be filtered by 15 teams respectively in Eastern and Western
  conferences. Here, we randomly pick 8 teams as our references and then scraping the data from tweets.
  
  - Since we cannot obtain the data for more than past 30 days from the standard Twitter API, we move on to find another way to gain the data.
  
  - We apply Twitter search engine to receive the tweets related to “NBA teams” in 2016. The basic idea is to request directly from tweets and then return them as JSON files.
